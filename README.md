# Airport-Operations-Optimization-Dashboard

Kindly download the `BIS_Project.twbx` file on your local PC to interact with the dashboard.

### Introduction:
This document outlines the plan for developing an interactive dashboard developed in Tableau aimed at optimizing operations for the five busiest airports in the USA. The primary goal is to provide data-driven insights to airport authorities to improve efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance passenger satisfaction. The dashboard will focus on comparing performance metrics from 2023 and 2024, identifying delay patterns, and analyzing efficiency at different times and locations.

### Intended Users and Use Cases:
The primary intended users for this dashboard are airport authorities and operations teams. The key use case is operational optimization, focusing on:
 1. Monitoring performance trends for the top five busiest airports.
 2. Identifying inefficiencies in operations and delays.
 3. Analyzing seasonal and destination-wise trends.
 4. Enhancing decision-making using actionable insights from visualized data.

### Role played by Team:
What we're doing here is Data-Driven Decision Making to help airport managers optimize their operations for better efficiency and higher revenue generation
Analysis and insights extraction [operational inefficiencies, delay, cancellations and passenger flow issues.]
Recommendation for optimization [Operational efficiency, customer satisfaction and revenue opportunities]
Decision-Making and implementation  [It is used to implement new process - optimize scheduling, allocate resources better]
